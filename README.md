# tmux-conf
My tmux config file. Make sure you have `tmux` version no earlier than `2.4`.
You can check the version by running `tmux -V`.

It should just work out of box.  If you have internet, you should be able to
just do <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>space</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> the first time you use it.

Hope you have fun using this!

## Manual
The default key binding for this setup is <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>q</kbd>. For
help, you can do key binding and <kbd>?</kbd>.
