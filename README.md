# tmux-conf
My tmux config file. 

## Prerequisites
- `tmux` version no earlier than `2.4`
- Have [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) installed

You can check the version by running `tmux -V`.

It should work out of box. To install all the plugins,
just do <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>q</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> the first time you use it.

Have fun using this!

## Manual
The default key binding for this setup is <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>q</kbd>. For
help, you can do key binding and <kbd>?</kbd>.
